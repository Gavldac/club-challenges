# Club Challenges
## Introduction
  **Welcome to Salt Lake Community College's Programming Club Challenges!**  
  These challenges are designed for programmers of all skill levels. Each challenge has a "core" problem that should be accessible to all.  
  Each challenge has progressively more difficult "bonus challenges" to test your programming knowledge.

## Getting Started with Basic Git Commands
  `git clone https://github.com/quaxlyqueen/club-challenges`                                   ~ Makes a local copy of the repository on your machine.  
  `git pull`                                                                                   ~ Retrieves the most recent changes from the "remote" repository (GitHub).  
  `git branch NAME`                                                                            ~ Creates a new branch called NAME. Substitute this with the changes you're making.  
  `git checkout NAME`                                                                          ~ Changes your current branch to NAME. The default branch is `main`.  
  `git stage -A`                                                                               ~ Prepares all of the changes in your local repository for a commit.  
  `git commit -m "A message"`                                                                  ~ Saves a snapshot of your local repository to your machine. You can revert back to this at anytime.  
  `git push`                                                                                   ~ Uploads your changes onto the remote repository (GitHub).  

  While this may seem complex, for future club challenges you'd simply need to type in the terminal `git pull` to get the next challenge.  

## Running Java code from the terminal  
  `javac File.java`                                                                            ~ Compiles your `.java` file into an executable `.class` file  
  `java File`                                                                                  ~ Executes your `.class` file

## FAQ
  **What is Git?**<br />Git is an industry-standard **V**ersion **C**ontrol **S**ystem (VCS), that allows multiple programmers to work on projects together asynchronously.  
  Git is a powerful **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface (CLI) tool, and GitHub is a way to visually interact with repositories.
  <br /><br />
  **What is a repository?**<br />A repository, or "repo", is a shareable project directory. There are two main types of repositories: remote and local.  
  A remote repository is a directory hosted on a server, such as GitHub. Whenever you clone a repository onto your machine, you have a local repository.  
  Think of this as a Google Docs for programmers, except instead of your changes being shared automatically, it is whenever **you** decide your changes  
  are ready to be shared.
